### Project Goal 

The aim of our project is to provide investors advice on which Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is best to invest in (best returns) based on their risk appetite, type of ETF they prefer and time period they want to keep their money invested in.

In this project, we applied financial analysis concepts to be able to give sound advice to investors. In coming up with financial advice we used financial programming concepts and skills to calculate ETFsâ€™ performance using historical data and forecasting future performance.
